    slide-1: Assalamualaikum and good-morning. Today I will present my work on a digital gift-card buying system.

    slide-2: 
        This is a Digital gift card system. User Can buy here Google-play gift cards, Apple card, Amazon gift-card, Netflix subscription gift card, Spotify subscription gift card. This system is only support crypto payment getway.

    slide-3 Motivation:
        First, in Bangladesh there are a lot of restrictions on international payments. On Amazon, Google Play, or gaming platforms—cards fail, OTP doesn’t arrive, verification is required, or sometimes the platform simply doesn’t support our cards. In this situation, gift cards are an easy and instant solution. They’re already very popular globally, and with just a code, the payment is completed immediately—no waiting at all.

        Second, our system supports only crypto payments. The reason is simple: crypto payments are fast and borderless. If a user uses crypto, they can buy a gift card instantly—without any bank or intermediary in the middle. Also, many young users are already familiar with the crypto ecosystem, so it becomes naturally accessible. With crypto integration, our system allow users to purchase products smoothly without traditional banking barriers.


    slide-4: Features
        In this system, buying a gift card is very simple. Even without logging in, a user can just enter their email and they’re ready to move to checkout.

        The system supports crypto payments — using Tron or BNB Chain — which makes transactions fast and low-cost.

        Delivery is instant. The moment the payment is confirmed, the gift card code is sent directly to the user’s email.

        There can be multiple admins as well. Admins can log in, view all orders, manage the cards, and handle other important tasks.
